2 Purpose of the document 
The Process Definition Document (PDD) captures the flow of a business process to be developed within 
Blue Prism. 
The flowchart contained within the document captures, at a high level, the business process to be 
automated, the target systems used within the process and any assumptions that have been taken into 
account. 
Once agreed as the basis for the automation of the target process, the flowchart and assumptions will be 
used as a platform from which the automated solution will be designed. 
Changes to this business process may constitute a request for change and will be subject to the agreed 
agility program change procedures. 
Note: This document must be completed in the absence of existing process documentation that provides 
the level of detail required for a process to be automated. If existing process documentation is to be used 
instead of a new PDD the following steps should still be undertaken 
• Existing process documentation reviewed to ensure it is still up to date and fully captures the 
current manual process 
• Existing process documentation provides the same level of detail that is required for automation 
• Agreed by the business as an accurate description of the manual process

Corporate - Corporate is billing platform. We do all admin related activities like Cost Center, Term Update, 
Dealer Code Update, Feature Update, Username, SOC Code Update, Price Plan Update on Large Corporate 
Accounts using bulk script to execute the changes. Changes can be done only if the CTN count is more 
than 26. 
Price Plan Update: Price Plan are combination of SOCs and Features as per the customer’s requirement 
and they provide some codes for that combination and it is prepared by tariff design team. We do changes 
on price plan using bulk script on Libra Billing Platform. 
SOC Code Update: SOC Code is combination of some additional benefit along with some features also 
include in that code as per the customer requirement and they provide some codes for that combination 
and it is prepared by tariff design team. We do changes on SOC as well using the same bulk script on Libra 
Billing Platform. 
Timing and availability of the Network:
Timing and availability of the Network to run the Migration is very vital in this process. Team has a limit to 
run only 7000 transactions in Live and 10,000 transaction limit in Overnight batches in a day. Based on 
Network availability team schedule Live and overnight batches. If the requestor has asked to run in a 
particular batch, we need to run as per the request. 
Live Batches: Live batches would work from 8 AM GMT to 3 PM GMT (Live batches we would the run the 
combination of the request –
Migration + SOC changes)
Overnight Batches: Overnight batches would start from 3 PM GMT. (In overnight batches we would run any 
straight requests like – only Migration/only Addition/only removal)

6 Process Availability/Constraints 
Process Availability 
• Once received email from “Gemini Operation” and email add is oper@weed.vfl.vodafone , 
stating “The Date for Corporate has now been rolled” – This is for process Migration. 
• Process SLAs: 
2 Working Days (48 Hours) - The number of CTN in Input file is less than 200 
10 Working Days - The number of CTN in Input file is more than 200 (It depends on Network 
availability) 
Constraints: 
• Input standardization is not in place. In some of the Input files – SOC addition and Removals are 
difficult to identify, as requestor is using dissimilar words. 
• SMEs transfers the files at UK Shared Drive using Skype. This is not a Standard Operating 
Procedure but a workaround as SMEs access has been revoked to access UK Network drive. 
• Migration date – there would be more of email communication between VVT team and 
Requestor regarding the “Migration date”. By looking at the Network availability team has to 
propose a Migration date to the Requestor. If the Requestor is not happy with slot – there may 
be much more communication to follow. 
• Keeping an eye on Network availability is also a challenge. As there is only 7000 transaction 
limit is available to run the Migration every day. If the Requested file is huge, the Migration 
needs to be divided and run into different dates. 
• Time Frame – Post confirmation from IT team that Batch date has been rolled, VVT needs to 
perform the transaction ASAP looking at the service queue status (No of Migration is a 
challenge). This way UK team can use the Network within the business hours to finish their 
transactions. 
• During a Migration- Team has to wait until the Service transaction or Device transaction queue 
shows the count as less than 1000. There is no specific time frame that the team can wait until 
it reduced to 1000. 
Communication Matrix: 
• Before starting the Migration for the specific date, VVT team is sending an email communication 
to the UK stakeholders and even post completion of Migration. 
• Before starting the Migration for the specific date for a specific Migration, VVT team is sending 
an email communication to the Requestor and needs to update the status in case of any issues 
in regular intervals. 
• Any issues within Network level or Services queue (Device transaction and Service Transaction) 
has to be highlighted to UK team. 
• If any issues within Services/Device/Error transaction queue (usually team needs to wait till the 
transaction count show less than 1000) if this continues to show more than 1000 for a long 
time, an email communication has to be send to “Error handling” team for an Investigation and 
mark this as well to UK stakeholders. Process Definition Document Ver: 1.3

• If the count of suspended CTN’s are more (75), need to send an email to “Bulk Update” team to 
restore all the suspended CTN’s before the Migration. This case has to be put hold or a time 
being.

Step 1: Need to check if the requestor has requested for “VGED/VONE – C Migration” in request email within eGain. If it is
mentioned, then only the VGED Migration should be followed and rest of the Steps would be same as “Direct Migration”
SIPOC 1. 
It can be find in Subject line sometime or in body of the email as well.

Step 4: Click on Enable editing as usual and check the no of CTN’s requested for, the count is 3104 in this case
Step 5: Do some basic calculations for the Migration part based on the CTN count, 3104 CTN’s*10 = 31,040 transactions 
Step 6: As we have only 7000 Transactions (700 CTN’s) limit for each day, here we have received 31,000 transactions. In 
the sense only “700” CTN’s can be Migrated on each day.
So need to prepare a file only for 700 CTN’s each day, need to follow the same and Migrate 700 CTN’s each day * 5 days
Step 7: Insert a new column as Column A and name the column as “Batch Details” Process Definition Document Ver: 1.3

Step 12: Follow same steps, put the VLOOKUP and check the CTN’s False or True. Remove all the exception (#N/A) details. Keep 
only genuine CTN’s to work on. Once all these done, create a “Pivot Table” as we did it in Direct Migration. Once the file is trimmed 
post Shed report and its basic process, we would find the exact no of CTN; s that needs to Migrated. 
As VGED process, we have to remove all the CTN’s (all the SOC codes) which we retain in the Shed report (Exact CTN’s post
trimming). All these codes needs to be removed as SOC removal process.
Step 13: We need to “Add” the SOC codes which are advised to add in the request Process Definition Document Ver: 1.3 
Corporate - EBU Admin Mass Updates - Price Plan Migration & SOC Update
 Page 206 of 248
Step 14: All other process steps are same. Remove the SOC code first in Application table and followed by price plan 
migration and then SOC Addition codes.
Step 15: While preparing the files for PP migration codes, make sure to add one more PP code as file “VFPORTMIG” and 
add all the CTN’s for this file. This is as per BAU, though it is not mentioned in request, we have to add and migrate all 
the CTN’s for “VFPORTMIG”
Step 16: Once the Migration is done for all 5 days (700*5) reply back to the input email from Requestor and attach the Execution 
report as per the process. Need to send each day’s Migration status to requestor.

11.3 SIPOC Process Step 3 - Parent Child to Normal Migration 
By looking at some price plans we can identify the Parent Child to normal Migration. For Instance, if we find Price plan VBS6000A2 
– This is child price plan and 
1. Remove all the SOCs which are advised to remove 
2. If you still find any SOC which GPRS dependable – also needs to be removed 
3. Once the removal process is done, Migrate the CTN in new tariff 
4. Once the Migration part is done, add the SOC’s which are advised to add 
5. Since we have removed GPRS dependable SOC – this needs to be re-added. 
VBS6000A1 – This is parent price plan

• Need to Migrate all Child CTN’s manually, as there is no Script in Bulk Table to add parent CTN 
• Need to remove all the SOC’s which are advised to remove and also remove GPRS dependable SOC’s 
• Migrate all CTN’s to VFORTMIG tariff, make sure the parent CTN should migrate Last on VFORTMIG Tariff 
• Start process manually to transfer the CTN on target tariff if that is parent child - Migrate first parent CTN and followed by 
Child CTN’s. 
• SOC Addition should be as per the requested plan and also make sure to add those Dependable SOC which are not requested 
to Remove. 
• There is one more chance – If we find Child CTN are 100 in numbers – Crystal Group saver and request is only for 90 CTN’s –
In this case the Parent CTN’s will not Migrate on New tariff. (It is important to find out the no of child CTN’s under a parent 
CTN before processing further) 
Step 1: Follow all the initial steps as is for the Direct Migration – eGain 
Step 2: Follow all the DPA’s checks as usual – restricted list, Mission Critical, Market type – Corporate.
